# Hepatitis_disease_prediction
This project describes the Hepatitis diseases affects on liver that can have a significant impact on a person's health. Machine learning techniques can be used to predict the risk of developing these diseases based on various factors such as age, sex, alcohol consumption, and viral infections. An ensemble classifier is a machine learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple models to improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the final prediction. For Hepatitis disease prediction, an ensemble classifier can be used to combine the predictions of multiple models to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis.
